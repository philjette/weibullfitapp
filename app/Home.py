    Weibullfit is a powerful statistical modeling application designed to help engineers and reliability professionals analyze asset life and failure probability through advanced Weibull distribution modeling. 
    
    Capabilities:
    - Generate failure curves using multiple fitting methods
    - Generate FMEAs based on asset characteristics and operating conditions 
    - Analyze the probability of failure over time
    - Compare different reliability models
    - Export data for further analysis
    
    ### Getting Started
    
    Navigate through the different pages using the sidebar menu to access various fitting methods:
    
    1. **Point-Based Fit**: Fit a curve by providing specific points on the cumulative distribution
    2. **Direct Parameter Fit**: Input shape and scale parameters directly
    3. **Guided Fit**: Answer questions about your assets to fit a general failure curve 
    4. **Historical Data Fit**: Upload a CSV file with asset data to fit a failure curve using statistical methods
    5. **FMEA-based fit**: Generate failure curves by failure mode based on an FMEA
